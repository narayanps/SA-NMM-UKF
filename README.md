"# SA-NMM-UKF" 
This repository contains the code and analysis used in our study on the parameter sensitivity of the Jansen and Rit Neural Mass Model (JR-NMM) for estimating neural parameters from EEG data. The JR-NMM is a well-established model for simulating the mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics of electroencephalography (EEG), including epileptic EEG. However, the high dimensionality of the model and the uncertainty in estimating its parameters pose significant challenges. This project aims to identify the most sensitive parameters within the JR-NMM and develop a reliable method for their estimation.
